<p>The regression module allows the user to compute a simple linear regression of a dependent variable (y) on an independent variable (x). The module will automatically filter any variables that are non-numeric so that the user may only select variables that are suitable for a simple linear regression.</p>

<p>Results of the regression will be displayed on the right. A table of parameter estimates, along with standard errors, t statistics, and p-values will be displayed. Beneath it, the r and R^2 values for the regression are displayed, as well as a scatterplot of the data along with a line of best fit. Finally, residual diagnostic plots, including a plot of residuals against the  independent variable (x), a normal quantile plot of the residuals, and a histogram of the residuals, will be printed at the bottom.</p>

<p>The users are also given the ability to save the residuals and fitted values from the regression back into the data. By clicking this bottom, two new columns will be created in the data, allowing the user to further explore these results.</p>
