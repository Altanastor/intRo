<h3>Code</h3>

The code button toggles the code panel. The code panel, visible at the bottom of the <code>intRo</code> interface, displays the code stored during the user's session. The code panel includes line numbers, as well as R code syntax highlighting. Note that each module includes a Store button which will allow the users to store the code generating the output in the Results Panel.
